            The M4 carbine (officially Carbine, Caliber 5.56 mm, M4) is an assault rifle developed in the United States during the 1980s. It is a shortened version of the M16A2 assault rifle. The M4 is <span style="color: red;">extensively used by the US military</span>, which decided to largely replace the M16 rifle in US Army (starting 2010) and US Marine Corps (starting 2016) combat units as the primary infantry weapon[7][8] and service rifle. The M4 has been adopted by over 60 countries worldwide,[9] and has been described as "one of the defining firearms of the 21st century".[10]

            The FN SCAR (SOF (Special Operations Forces) Combat Assault Rifle)[3] is a family of gas-operated short-stroke gas piston[4] automatic rifles developed by Belgian manufacturer FN Herstal (FN) in 2004.[5] It is constructed with modularity for the United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM) to satisfy the requirements of the SCAR competition.[6] This family of rifles consists of two main types. The SCAR-L, for "light", is chambered in 5.56×45mm NATO and the SCAR-H, for "heavy", is chambered in 7.62×51mm NATO. Both types are available in Close Quarters Combat (CQC), Standard (STD), and Long Barrel (LB) variants.

        <p>The Heckler & Koch HK416 is an assault rifle chambered for the 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge, designed and manufactured by the German company Heckler & Koch. Although the design is based on the selective fire M16 class of firearm (specifically the Colt M4 carbine family issued to the U.S. military), it uses a proprietary short-stroke gas piston system from the Heckler & Koch G36 family of rifles.</p>
